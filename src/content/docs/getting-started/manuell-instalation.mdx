# Manual Installation Steps

## Prerequisites

-   A local WordPress installation where the theme or plugin will be added.
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your local machine.
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed globally.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Check out the repository into your local WordPress installation**

-   For a theme: place the repository contents in `wp-content/themes/your-theme`.
-   For a plugin: place the repository contents in `wp-content/plugins/your-plugin`.

2. **Install Node.js and pnpm (if not already installed)**

-   Install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
-   Install pnpm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

<hr />

3. **Install dependencies**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

<hr />

4. **Run the development environment**
   This will start a local dev environment and watch for changes:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

<hr />

5. **Build for production**
   Once satisfied with your changes:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

<hr />

6. **Adjusting Purge Settings for Missing Styles**
   If some styles are missing after the build, add the relevant selectors or styles to:

-   purge.php, or
-   Purge ignore settings in the configuration files
    This ensures those styles won’t be removed in the production build.

You’re all set! You now have a local development environment ready for making changes and producing production-ready builds as needed.
